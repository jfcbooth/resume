    \para{Dear Hiring Manager,}
    \para{
        Oppo is a global technology leader and finding a position that continues to enable me to exercise my best skills is a dream come true.
    }
    \para{
        As a young engineer with 5 years of industry experience, my expertise is in embedded systems, C, Python, and PCB design.
        During my time as a prototype and marketing engineer, I designed and debugged hardware prototypes for clients. I've designed PCBs that handle PoE,
        analog, and communications protocols including I2C, SPI, UART, and DMX. I've also designed analog systems for power, temperature, and analog readings
        (as shown in my resume under The Cold Plate and DMX light show.)
            }
    \para{
        I have a strong interest in joining a team of other self-starting engineers whose talents and creativity will help me make a meaningful impact both in the company and in the tech space as a whole.
        With my track record of turning ideas into reality, I am confident that my skills and competitive nature align with the innovative spirit and drive Oppo needs.
    }
    \para{
        I hope to hear back from you soon.
    }
    \para{        
        Best, \\
        Josh
