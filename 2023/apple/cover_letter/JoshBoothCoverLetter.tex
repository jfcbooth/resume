    \para{Dear Hiring Manager,}
    \para{
        Apple is a global technology leader and finding a position that continues to enable me to exercise my best skills is a dream come true.
    }
    \para{
        I am currently a technical marketing engineer at Microchip where I create microcontroller demos as a way to educate customers about their products.
        The most important aspect of that job is to empathize with the customer and how they might view a feature, building a demo to help shape that perspective.
        The firmware quality engineer position at Apple will continue to let me bridge my need to exercise my technical skills
        while still utilizing my extroverted personality and people skills to best shape a product.
    }
    \para{
        I have a strong interest in joining a team of other self-starting engineers whose talents and creativity will help me make a meaningful impact both in the company and in the tech space as a whole.
        With my track record of turning ideas into reality, I am confident that my skills and competitive nature align with the innovative spirit and drive Apple needs.
    }
    \para{
        I hope to hear back from you soon.
    }
    \para{        
        Best, \\
