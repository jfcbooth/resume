Verge Aero Hiring Manager,

Your company's position caught my eye because it is one of the few areas in the tech space that combines many engineering disciplines
to create awe-inspiring performances. 

I am a self-starter who enjoys has enjoyed building cool gadgets and practical projects because I have the programming and hardware skills
to do it. The thing I enjoy most in life is challenging myself to build cool shit. At Verge Aero, you have assembled a team of individuals
who talent and drive is comprable to my own, and I would love to be a part of it and work with people who match my drive.

Included in this email is my resume that highlights a few of my embedded projects to show my engineering skills, but it doesn't show
my desire to create stuff that no one else in the world can; which I believe you have a team that can bring the best out of me in terms
of making cool shit.
